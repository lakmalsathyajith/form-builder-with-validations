# React Form validator

This is a simple React Js application to enhance the form validation capabilities of the given form builder


## React JS 
React is a popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) and user interface components. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React is widely used for building dynamic and responsive web applications, and it has gained significant adoption in the web development industry.

### Key features
Component-Based Architecture

Virtual DOM

Declarative Syntax

JSX (JavaScript XML)

State Management

Unidirectional Data Flow

Reusable Components

Virtual DOM Diffing

Lifecycle Methods (Class Components)

Hooks

### Redux
Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing the state of an application. It's commonly used in combination with React. Redux provides a predictable state container that helps manage complex application states and makes state changes more maintainable and traceable, especially in larger applications.


## Acknowledgements

I have used a custom react hook to encapsulate the validation logic, which shared a state which includes all the validation satatus (including errors) of the given fields.

By passing field data to the hook it will output relevent validation data which can be used in the time of form submission
